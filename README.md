# Unity UI Toolbox

Unity UI Toolbox is a package that contains shared assets and code for my projects. It has a FPS counter, a modular panel (UI that looks the same from scene to scene and you can build through code) and adaptive UI (a system that allowes you to change layout based on screen orientation).

You can find examples of how to use this library in [Common Unity Samples](https://github.com/m039/CommonUnitySamples) project.

Unity UI Toolbox depends on [Common Unity Library](https://github.com/m039/CommonUnityLibrary).
